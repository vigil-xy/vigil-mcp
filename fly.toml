# See https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/ for information about how to use this file.
#
# NOTE: This file is a placeholder. vigil-mcp is an MCP server that communicates via stdio,
# not an HTTP service. To deploy on Fly.io, you'll need to:
# 1. Create an HTTP bridge server that spawns vigil-mcp as a subprocess
# 2. Update this configuration to point to the bridge server
# 3. Remove the http_service section if deploying the bridge server
#
# See ARCHITECTURE.md for details on deployment models.
